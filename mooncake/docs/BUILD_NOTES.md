# Build Process Reflections

This document outlines key learnings and common pitfalls encountered during the build process of the Mooncake application.

## Key Learnings:

1.  **Dependency Management is Crucial:** The initial build failures were primarily due to dependency issues. Specifically, the `use-audio` hook had a dependency on the `firebase` package, which was not explicitly listed in the `package.json`. This highlighted the importance of carefully managing dependencies and ensuring that all required packages are properly declared.

2.  **Authentication Context in Builds:** The `useAudio` hook requires an ID token, which is obtained from the `useAuth` hook. During the build process, the authentication context is not available, which can lead to errors. The solution was to modify the `VoiceController` component to handle cases where the user is not authenticated.

3.  **Thorough Testing is Essential:** The build errors could have been caught earlier with more comprehensive testing. The testing process should include scenarios where the user is not authenticated to ensure that the application behaves gracefully in all situations.

## Common Pitfalls & Mistakes to Avoid:

*   **Implicit Dependencies:** Avoid relying on implicit dependencies. If a module requires a specific package, ensure that the package is explicitly listed in the `package.json` file.

*   **Missing Authentication Context:** When a component relies on authentication, always account for the possibility that the user may not be signed in. This is especially important during the build process, when the authentication context is not available.

*   **Incomplete Testing:** Test all possible scenarios, including those where the user is not authenticated. This will help to identify potential issues before they become major problems.
