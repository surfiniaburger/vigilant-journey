Requirements are: the driver's door is closed, the engine is at normal operating temperature, the front wheel is in a straight-ahead position, and the vehicle is on level ground. One of the drive programs Sport, Sport+, or RACE must be selected. To activate, rapidly depress the accelerator pedal fully. A 'Release brake to start' message will appear. Take your foot off the brake to pull away at maximum acceleration. Using RACE START multiple times in short succession may cause it to become temporarily unavailable."

The RACE program is for use on dedicated race circuits, not public roads. Depending on the selected program, vehicle characteristics such as engine and transmission management, Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC, AMG Dynamics, suspension, steering, and the position of the exhaust gas flaps will change."

Depending on the drive program and driving speed, the profile will automatically extend or retract to move into the ideal position. Manual intervention is not intended for driving situations. It can be manually extended for cleaning purposes when the vehicle is in park and the ignition is on."

If the front passenger airbag is enabled, a child on the front passenger seat may be struck by the front passenger airbag during an accident. NEVER use a rearward facing child restraint system on a seat protected by an ENABLED FRONT AIRBAG in front of it; this can result in DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the child.

The loads and temperatures which occur when driving on a racetrack inherently lead to increased wear of the brake system. Check the condition of brakepads, brake discs, and brake fluid before each use on a racetrack. Repeated hard braking within the ABS control range causes higher temperatures than controlled braking."
